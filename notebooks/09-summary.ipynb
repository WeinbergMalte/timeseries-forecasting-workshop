    "## What we (might have) learned today &#x1F913;\n",
    "- Time series are everywhere\n",
    "- They're a bit peculiar and require special treatment\n",
    "- We can do time series forecasting with a wide variety of machine learning techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where we maybe scratched the surface &#x1F914;\n",
    "- Good old fashioned feature engineering\n",
    "- Time series decomposition\n",
    "- Multi-step ahead forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we didn't cover &#x1FAE3;\n",
    "- Backtesting: Thorough model evaluation on historical data with\n",
    "  - Rolling window\n",
    "  - Expanding window\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Some tried-and-tested stuff like autoregressive models, ARIMA, SARIMA, ... you name it.\n",
    "- The stuff I would often use in production for multiple multi-variate multi-step time series forecasting problems: A strong gradient boosted decision tree model like LightGBM wrapped in some custom made recursive estimator.\n",
    "- Uncertainty estimation, i.e. confidence intervals\n",
    "- Some more advanced stuff like recurrent neural networks:\n",
    "  - LSTMs\n",
    "  - The new real deal that can do it all: Temporal Fusion Transformers!\n",
